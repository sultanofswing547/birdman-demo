# birdman-demo
this is the biggest project i've worked on i think, trying to make a demo for a huge indie game
if all of the commits in this repo seem confusing, just go through the commits in chronological order
this is because i'm building an entire game from scratch and documenting everything on here for the hack club hours, so things might pile up and seem like a lot is going on
i promise once i have the game done, everything will make sense because everything (including rough sketches, scrapped designs, etc) contributed to the production of the game
